Tika

- To extract pdf content use XHTML rather that plain text. Split on the page divs.
- Do we want deleted text from docs?
- Turn off extraction of deleted text with “OfficeParserConfig#setIncludeDeletedContent”. Does not work for docx.
- Check status of server against lightweight endpoint /status.
- Look into Tika Pipes.
- Client code needs to be able to handle the times when tika-server is restarting and is not available
